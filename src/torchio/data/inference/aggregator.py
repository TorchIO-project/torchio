class GridAggregator:
    r"""Aggregate patches for dense inference.

    This class is typically used to build a volume made of patches after
    inference of batches extracted by a :class:`~torchio.data.GridSampler`.

    Args:
        sampler: Instance of :class:`~torchio.data.GridSampler` used to
            extract the patches.
        overlap_mode: If ``'crop'``, the overlapping predictions will be
            cropped. If ``'average'``, the predictions in the overlapping areas
            will be averaged with equal weights. If ``'hann'``, the predictions
            in the overlapping areas will be weighted with a Hann window
            function. See the `grid aggregator tests`_ for a raw visualization
            of the three modes.
